The incr ease in stem thickness that r esults fr om sec ondar y gr owth is due to the activity of the later al meristems , which ar e
lacking in herbac eous plants . Later al meristems include the v ascular c ambium and, in w oody plants , the c ork c ambium (see
Figur e 30.10 ). The v ascular c ambium is loc ated just outside the primar y xylem and to the interior of the primar y phloem. The
cells of the v ascular c ambium divide and f orm sec ondar y xylem (tr acheids and v essel elements) to the inside , and sec ondar y
phloem (siev e elements and c ompanion c ells) to the outside . The thick ening of the stem that oc curs in sec ondar y gr owth is due
to the f ormation of sec ondar y phloem and sec ondar y xylem b y the v ascular c ambium, plus the action of c ork c ambium, which
forms the tough outermost la yer of the stem. The c ells of the sec ondar y xylem c ontain lignin, which pr ovides har diness and

Chunk 1 [Section 9.4]:
----------------------------------------
Figure 9.5 Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds. The open pore
then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.
G-protein-linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G-protein. The activated G-protein then
interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane (Figure 9.6 ). All G-protein-linked receptors have seven
transmembrane domains, but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and G-protein-binding site.
Cell signaling using G-protein-linked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events. Before the ligand binds, the inactive G-protein
can bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding. Once the G-protein binds to the receptor, the resulting
change in shape activates the G-protein, which releases guanosine diposphate (GDP) and picks up guanosine 3-phosphate

Chunk 2 [Section 9.4]:

change in shape activates the G-protein, which releases guanosine diposphate (GDP) and picks up guanosine 3-phosphate
(GTP). The subunits of the G-protein then split into the αsubunit and the βγsubunit. One or both of these G-protein fragments
may be able to activate other proteins as a result. After awhile, the GTP on the active αsubunit of the G-protein is hydrolyzed to
GDP and the βγsubunit is deactivated. The subunits reassociate to form the inactive G-protein and the cycle begins anew.232 Chapter 9 • Cell Communication

Ion channel-linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through.
To form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region. In order to interact with the
double layer of phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the
membrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are
hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there is a
conformational change in the protein's structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to pass
through (Figure 9.5 ).

then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.

Direct Signaling Across Gap Junctions
Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells.
These fluid-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called intracellular mediators, to diffuse between the two cells.
Small molecules or ions, such as calcium ions (Ca2+), are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and DNA
cannot fit through the channels. The specificity of the channels ensures that the cells remain independent but can quickly and
easily transmit signals. The transfer of signaling molecules communicates the current state of the cell that is directly next to the

If a peripher al membr ane pr otein w ere synthesized in the lumen (inside) of the ER, w ould it end up on the inside or outside of

The Endoplasmic R eticulum
The endoplasmic r eticulum (ER) (Figur e 4.18 ) is a series of inter connected membr anous sacs and tubules that c ollectiv ely
modifies pr oteins and synthesizes lipids . However, these tw o functions tak e plac e in separ ate ar eas of the ER: the r ough ER and
the smooth ER, r espectiv ely.
We call the ER tubules' hollo w portion the lumen or cisternal spac e. The ER 's membr ane, which is a phospholipid bila yer
embedded with pr oteins , is c ontinuous with the nuclear en velope .

Chunk 2 [Section 4.8]:
----------------------------------------
If the phospholipids or modified pr oteins ar e not destined to sta y in the RER, they will r each their destinations via tr ansport
vesicles that bud fr om the RER ’s membr ane ( Figur e 4.18 ).
Since the RER is eng aged in modifying pr oteins (such as enzymes , for e xample) that secr ete fr om the c ell, y ou w ould be c orrect
in assuming that the RER is abundant in c ells that secr ete pr oteins . This is the c ase with liv er cells, for e xample .
Smoo th ER
The smooth endoplasmic r eticulum (SER) is continuous with the RER but has f ew or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surf ace
(Figur e 4.18 ). SER functions include synthesis of c arboh ydrates , lipids , and ster oid hormones; deto xific ation of medic ations and
poisons; and storing c alcium ions .
In muscle c ells, a specialized SER, the sar coplasmic r eticulum, is r esponsible f or storing c alcium ions that ar e needed to trigger

Relevant Context:
Here are the most relevant sections from the textbook:

Chunk 1 [Section 9.4]:
----------------------------------------
Ion channel-linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through.
To form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region. In order to interact with the
double layer of phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the
membrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are
hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there is a
conformational change in the protein's structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to pass
through (Figure 9.5 ).
Figure 9.5 Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds. The open pore
then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.

passage . An example of this oc curs in the kidney , wher e ther e ar e both channel f orms in diff erent parts of the r enal tubules . Cells
involved in tr ansmitting electric al impulses , such as ner ve and muscle c ells, have gated channels f or sodium, potassium, and
calcium in their membr anes . Opening and closing these channels changes the r elativ e concentr ations on opposing sides of the
membr ane of these ions , resulting in f acilitating electric al tr ansmission along membr anes (in the c ase of ner ve cells) or in
muscle c ontr action (in the c ase of muscle c ells).
Carrier P roteins
Another type of pr otein embedded in the plasma membr ane is a carrier pr otein . This aptly named pr otein binds a substanc e
and, thus triggers a change of its o wn shape , mo ving the bound molecule fr om the c ell's outside to its interior ( Figur e 5.10 ).

Chunk 3 [Section 9.4]:
----------------------------------------
Figure 9.5 Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds. The open pore
then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.
G-protein-linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G-protein. The activated G-protein then
interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane (Figure 9.6 ). All G-protein-linked receptors have seven
transmembrane domains, but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and G-protein-binding site.
Cell signaling using G-protein-linked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events. Before the ligand binds, the inactive G-protein
can bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding. Once the G-protein binds to the receptor, the resulting
change in shape activates the G-protein, which releases guanosine diposphate (GDP) and picks up guanosine 3-phosphate

Contr ol of Ca tabolic P athways
Enzymes , proteins , electr on c arriers , and pumps that pla y roles in gly colysis , the citric acid cy cle, and the electr on tr ansport
chain tend to c atalyze nonr eversible r eactions . In other w ords, if the initial r eaction tak es plac e, the path way is c ommitted to

the c ell (as r eflected b y the lev els of A TP, ADP , and AMP).
Glycolysis

As y ou ha ve read, nearly all of the energy used b y living c ells c omes to them in the bonds of the sug ar gluc ose.Glycolysis is the
first step in the br eakdown of gluc ose to e xtract energy f or c ellular metabolism. I n fact, nearly all living org anisms c arry out
glycolysis as part of their metabolism. The pr ocess does not use o xygen dir ectly and ther efore is termed anaer obic . Glycolysis
takes plac e in the cytoplasm of both pr okaryotic and euk aryotic c ells. Glucose enters heter otrophic c ells in tw o ways. One
method is thr ough sec ondar y activ e transport in which the tr ansport tak es plac e ag ainst the gluc ose c oncentr ation gr adient. The
other mechanism uses a gr oup of inte gral pr oteins c alled GLUT pr oteins , also kno wn as gluc ose tr ansporter pr oteins . These
transporters assist in the f acilitated diffusion of gluc ose.

Firs t Half o f Glycolysis (Ener gy-Requiring S teps)
Step 1 . The first step in gly colysis ( Figur e 7.6 ) is c atalyzed b y he xokinase , an enzyme with br oad specificity that c atalyzes the
phosphor ylation of six -carbon sug ars. Hexokinase phosphor ylates gluc ose using A TP as the sour ce of the phosphate , producing
gluc ose-6-phosphate , a mor e reactiv e form of gluc ose. This r eaction pr events the phosphor ylated gluc ose molecule fr om
continuing to inter act with the GLUT pr oteins , and it c an no longer lea ve the c ell bec ause the ne gativ ely charged phosphate will
not allo w it to cr oss the h ydrophobic interior of the plasma membr ane.
Step 2 . In the sec ond step of gly colysis , an isomer ase c onverts gluc ose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers ,
fructose-6-phosphate (this isomer has a phosphate attached at the loc ation of the sixth c arbon of the ring). A nisomer ase is an

carbon, pr oducing 2-phosphogly cerate (an isomer of 3-phosphogly cerate). The enzyme c atalyzing this step is a mutase
(isomer ase).
Step 9 . Enolase c atalyzes the ninth step . This enzyme c auses 2-phosphogly cerate to lose w ater fr om its structur e; this is a
deh ydration r eaction, r esulting in the f ormation of a double bond that incr eases the potential energy in the r emaining
phosphate bond and pr oduc es phosphoenolp yruv ate (PEP).
Step 10 . The last step in gly colysis is c atalyzed b y the enzyme p yruv ate kinase (the enzyme in this c ase is named f or the r everse
reaction of p yruv ate’s conversion into PEP) and r esults in the pr oduction of a sec ond A TP molecule b y substr ate-lev el

As A TP is used f or energy , a phosphate gr oup or tw o ar e

deriv ed fr om gluc ose c atabolism is used to c onvert ADP into
ATP. When A TP is used in a r eaction, the thir d phosphate is
tempor arily attached to a substr ate in a pr ocess c alled
phosphor ylation. The tw o pr ocesses of A TP r egener ation that
are used in c onjunction with gluc ose c atabolism ar e

Glycolysis is the first path way within the cytoplasm used in
the br eakdown of gluc ose to e xtract energy . It w as pr obably
one of the earliest metabolic path ways to ev olve and is used
by nearly all of the org anisms on E arth. G lycolysis c onsists of

Some atoms ar e mor e stable when they g ain or lose an electr on (or possibly tw o) and f orm ions . This fills their outermost

Some atoms ar e mor e stable when they g ain or lose an electr on (or possibly tw o) and f orm ions . This fills their outermost
electr on shell and mak es them energetic ally mor e stable . Because the number of electr ons does not equal the number of
protons , each ion has a net charge .Cations are positiv e ions that f orm b y losing electr ons. Negativ e ions f orm b y gaining
electr ons, which w e call anions . We designate anions by their elemental name and change the ending to “-ide ”, thus the anion of
chlorine is chloride , and the anion of sulfur is sulfide .

pair of tubes on the dorsal side , called the c orpus c avernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the v entr al side , called the c orpus
spongiosum. This tissue will bec ome engorged with blood, bec oming er ect and har d, in pr epar ation f or inter course . The org an
is inserted into the v agina culminating with an ejaculation. During inter course , the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to
the r enal bladder close and pr event urine fr om entering the penis . An org asm is a tw o-stage pr ocess: first, glands and ac cessor y
organs c onnected to the testes c ontr act, then semen (c ontaining sperm) is e xpelled thr ough the ur ethr a during ejaculation. After

Transitional Epithelia
Transitional or ur oepithelial c ells appear only in the urinar y system, primarily in the bladder and ur eter . These c ells ar e
arranged in a str atified la yer, but they ha ve the c apability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a r elax ed, empty
bladder , as illustr ated in Figur e 33.11 . As the urinar y bladder fills , the epithelial la yer unf olds and e xpands to hold the v olume of
urine intr oduc ed into it. As the bladder fills , it e xpands and the lining bec omes thinner . In other w ords, the tissue tr ansitions33.2 • Animal P rimar y Tissues 929

Another hormone r esponsible f or maintaining electr olyte c oncentr ations in e xtracellular fluids is aldoster one , a ster oid
hormone that is pr oduc ed b y the adr enal c orte x. In contr ast to ADH , which pr omotes the r eabsorption of w ater to maintain
proper w ater balanc e, aldoster one maintains pr oper w ater balanc e by enhancing N a+reabsorption and K+secr etion fr om
